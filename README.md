# Calculator
This is a simple yet functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, styling with CSS, and handling user inputs in JavaScript.
